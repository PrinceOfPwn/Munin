# Hell's Gate / Halo's Gate / Tartarus Gate + FreshyCalls — Operator Playbook

## TL;DR
A four-stage SSN (System Service Number) resolution cascade that defeats EDR inline hooks on ntdll syscall stubs. Stage P1 (FreshyCalls, in `crowd/src/resolve.rs::resolve_export_ssn`) sorts all `Zw*` exports by RVA — since Windows assigns SSNs in RVA order, the sort index *is* the SSN, with zero bytes read from any potentially-hooked stub. Stage 1 (Hell's Gate, `hells_gate.rs::read_ssn_from_stub`) reads the canonical `4C 8B D1 B8 XX XX 00 00` stub directly. Stage 2 (Halo's Gate, `hells_gate.rs::halos_gate`) walks ±20 neighbor exports to infer SSN by ordinal proximity when the target stub is trampolined. Stage 3 (Tartarus Gate, `hells_gate.rs::tartarus_gate`) cross-references the PE Exception Directory (`RuntimeFunctionEntry`) with the export table and assigns SSNs purely by RVA order, defeating full-coverage hooking. The cascade also surfaces `0F 05 C3` (syscall;ret) gadget addresses that feed RecycledGate (T-001). Worth the complexity because every NT-direct technique in the vault depends on this output.

## How It Works

### Stage P1 — FreshyCalls (Zw* RVA Sort)
File: `crowd/src/resolve.rs::resolve_export_ssn` (L194-L259)

1. `ntdll_base_and_name_hashes()` (L99-L122, 64-bit) reads `gs:[0x60]` to get the PEB, then walks `PEB->Ldr->InMemoryOrderModuleList` computing DJB2 hash of each module's `BaseDllName` (case-folded via `| 0x20`) until it matches `djb2_hash(b"ntdll.dll")` (= `0x1edab0ed`). Returns the ntdll base pointer.
2. `resolve_export_ssn()` parses the PE export directory at offset `nt_headers + 0x88` (DataDirectory[0]) — `ImageExportDirectory` struct (L173-L186) is walked by name via `address_of_names`, `address_of_name_ordinals`, `address_of_functions`.
3. **FreshyCalls core**: During the export-name loop, every export starting with bytes `Z`,`w` is collected into `zw_funcs: Vec<u32>` with its RVA (L226-L228). After the loop, `zw_funcs.sort_unstable()` (L237) sorts by RVA.
4. The target function's RVA is matched against `zw_funcs`; the sorted *index* becomes the SSN (L240-L245):
 ```rust
 for (i, &rva) in zw_funcs.iter().enumerate() {
 if rva == target_func_rva { ssn = i as u32; break; }
 }
 ```
5. Gadget hunt: scan up to 512 bytes forward from `target_ptr` looking for `0F 05 C3` (syscall; ret). If not found there, fall back to scanning from `zw_funcs[0]` (L247-L266). This is the RecycledGate dispatch gadget.
6. Returns `(ssn, gadget)`. **Critical**: no bytes from any `Nt*`/`Zw*` *stub body* are read for SSN extraction — only the export *name* and *RVA*. This makes FreshyCalls immune to inline hooks that rewrite stub bodies.

### Stage 1 — Hell's Gate (Direct Stub Read)
File: `crowd/src/hells_gate.rs::read_ssn_from_stub` (L202-L226)

1. `find_ntdll_base()` (L85-L122) uses inline asm `mov {}, gs:[0x60]` to fetch PEB, walks InMemoryOrderModuleList, hashes each `BaseDllName` with DJB2 in-loop, matches `NTDLL_HASH = 0x1edab0ed`.
2. `parse_exports(base)` (L145-L191) validates `MZ` (0x5A4D) and `PE` (0x4550) signatures, reads export directory at `nt_headers + EXPORT_DIR_OFFSET (0x88)`, filters exports starting with `Nt` but excluding `Ntdll`, collects `(name, va)` pairs, sorts by address (= RVA order = SSN assignment order).
3. `read_ssn_from_stub(addr)` checks bytes `[0..4]` against `CLEAN_STUB_PREFIX = [0x4C, 0x8B, 0xD1, 0xB8]` (`mov r10, rcx; mov eax, imm32`). Verifies bytes `[6..8]` are `0x00 0x00` (SSN fits in u16). Returns `Some(ssn_lo | (ssn_hi << 8))` extracted from bytes `[4..6]`.
4. `is_hooked(addr)` (L240-L244) — secondary diagnostic, returns true if first byte is `0xE9` (JMP rel32 trampoline).

### Stage 2 — Halo's Gate (Neighbor Walk)
File: `crowd/src/hells_gate.rs::halos_gate` (L257-L287)

1. Operates on the *sorted* `exports: &[(String, *const u8)]` list from `parse_exports()`. The target's `idx` is its position in this sorted list.
2. For `distance in 1..=HALOS_MAX_DISTANCE (=20)`:
 - **Down**: `exports[idx + distance]` — if its stub is clean (passes `read_ssn_from_stub`), `target_SSN = neighbor_SSN - distance` (saturating, returns None if `neighbor_ssn < distance`).
 - **Up**: `exports[idx - distance]` — if clean, `target_SSN = neighbor_SSN + distance`.
3. Returns `Some(ssn)` on first clean neighbor hit, `None` if none found within ±20.

Key insight: this works because Windows assigns SSNs to syscall stubs in RVA order, so a clean neighbor at sorted-index-distance `d` has SSN exactly `±d` from the target.

### Stage 3 — Tartarus Gate (Exception Directory Cross-Reference)
File: `crowd/src/hells_gate.rs::tartarus_gate` (L321-L378)

1. Reads the PE Exception Directory at `nt_headers + EXCEPTION_DIR_OFFSET (0xA0)` with size at `+0xA4`.
2. Builds a `HashSet<u32>` of all `RuntimeFunctionEntry.begin_address` values — these are RVAs of *every* function in ntdll that has unwind metadata (real function entry points, not data exports).
3. Takes `parse_exports()` output (Nt* sorted by RVA), filters to only those whose RVA appears in `exc_entries`. This validates each export is a genuine function entry, not a forwarded/data export.
4. Assigns SSNs sequentially by sorted RVA index: `validated[0] → SSN 0`, `validated[1] → SSN 1`, etc. (L371-L374).
5. Fallbacks: if Exception Directory is empty (L335-L343) or filter yields empty (L357-L363), falls back to pure RVA ordering of all Nt* exports.

### Gadget Acquisition (feeds T-001 RecycledGate)
File: `crowd/src/hells_gate.rs::find_syscall_ret_gadget` (L386-L401)

Scans up to 64 bytes forward from a stub for `0F 05 C3` (syscall; ret). `find_gadget_near()` (L519-L542) walks neighbors ±20 looking for a clean stub with an intact gadget. `find_any_gadget()` (L551-L561) scans every export as last resort.

### Three-stage resolve (single function)
`resolve_ssn(func_name)` (L427-L467) cascade:
1. Hell's Gate direct read — if success, locate gadget.
2. Halo's Gate neighbor walk — if success, locate nearby gadget.
3. Tartarus Gate exception-directory map — if name found, use `find_any_gadget()`.

### Three-pass batch resolve
`resolve_all()` (L478-L528): Pass 1 Hell's on every export → Pass 2 Halo's on unresolved → Pass 3 Tartarus for remaining. Each pass only attempts unresolved indices, so cost scales with hook coverage.

```

### Data flow
- **Input**: target syscall name (e.g., `"NtAllocateVirtualMemory"`) → DJB2 hash → PEB walk → ntdll base.
- **Internal**: PE export table parsed, Nt*/Zw* entries filtered and sorted by RVA.
- **Output**: `(ssn: u16|u32, gadget_addr: usize)` — the SSN for syscall dispatch, and a `0F 05 C3` gadget address inside ntdll used by RecycledGate indirect dispatch (T-001).

### Type hierarchy
- `Peb` → `PebLdrData` → `ListEntry` (doubly-linked) → `LdrDataTableEntry` (with `dll_base`, `base_dll_name: UnicodeString`)
- `ImageExportDirectory` is the in-memory PE export table layout
- `RuntimeFunctionEntry` (x64 only) is the `IMAGE_RUNTIME_FUNCTION_ENTRY` for exception unwind data, used exclusively by Tartarus

### Feature gates
- All x64 paths are `#[cfg(target_arch = "x86_64")]`
- All x86 paths are `#[cfg(target_arch = "x86")]` with WoW64 detection via `fs:[0xC0]`
- Tartarus Gate `RuntimeFunctionEntry` is x64-only; on x86 it returns `HashMap::new()` (L382-L385), forcing fallback to pure RVA sort

## Operational Profile

### When to Use
- **Always** for any NT-direct syscall work — the cost is one-time at implant init.
- Engagement against EDR with userland hooking (CrowdStrike, SentinelOne, Defender for Endpoint) — FreshyCalls alone defeats hook-based SSN interception.
- Engagement against EDR with full stub rewriting — Tartarus fallback handles this.
- Whenever the chain calls NT APIs directly (T-007 through T-017 all depend on this).

### When NOT to Use
- Targets where ntdll itself is integrity-checked from a clean shadow copy (e.g., some PPL/ELAM scenarios) — the gadgets and stubs may be re-imaged.
- Cross-architecture work — Tartarus is x64-only; on x86 you fall back to RVA sort without exception-directory validation.
- Targets with kernel-mode syscall callbacks (PsSetCreateProcessNotifyRoutine, ObRegisterCallbacks) — these are not fooled by userland SSN resolution; you need T-003 VEH Gate or kernel techniques.

### Kill Chain Position
This is the foundation. Reference chain:

T-004 (PEB walk) → **T-002 (SSN cascade)** → T-001 (RecycledGate dispatch) → T-012 (Early Cascade) → T-005 (Ekko sleep) → T-017 (persistence)

Every NT syscall in the implant (allocate, write, protect, create thread, create process, etc.) flows through here.

## Rust Implementation Deep Dive

### `unsafe` blocks

1. **`crowd/src/hells_gate.rs::find_ntdll_base()` L85-L122** — Inline `core::arch::asm!("mov {}, gs:[0x60]", lateout(reg) peb, options(nostack, readonly, pure))`. Reads TEB→PEB. Then dereferences `*(*peb).ldr` and walks the list. `pure` and `readonly` options promise no memory writes, allowing the optimizer to CSE the PEB read.
2. **`crowd/src/hells_gate.rs::read_ssn_from_stub(addr)` L202-L226** — Dereferences 8 raw bytes from a code pointer. Page-crossing protection is implicit because the canonical stub is always 8-byte aligned within a 16-byte block.
3. **`crowd/src/hells_gate.rs::halos_gate()` L257-L287** — Calls `read_ssn_from_stub` on neighbor pointers; arithmetic `neighbor_ssn - distance as u16` is checked with `if neighbor_ssn >= distance as u16` (L269) to prevent underflow.
4. **`crowd/src/hells_gate.rs::tartarus_gate()` L321-L378** — Reads `RuntimeFunctionEntry` array via `exc_base.add(i)`. HashSet allocation under unsafe context. Two fallback paths (L335-L343, L357-L363) handle missing/empty exception directory.
5. **`crowd/src/hells_gate.rs::parse_exports()` L145-L191** — PE header traversal, `from_raw_parts` over export name C-strings. Length computed by `while *cstr.add(len) != 0` (L171-L173).
6. **`crowd/src/hells_gate.rs::find_syscall_ret_gadget()` L386-L401** — 64-byte linear scan with `*p == 0x0F && *p.add(1) == 0x05 && *p.add(2) == 0xC3` pattern match.
7. **`crowd/src/resolve.rs::resolve_export_ssn()` L194-L259** — Generic PE export walk with closure-based SSN extraction (though the crowd version ignores the closure and implements FreshyCalls inline).
8. **`crowd/src/resolve.rs::find_syscall_stub64()` L261-L307** — RecycledGate-style ±512 byte neighbor scan with `matches_stub64()` prefix check, then 32-byte forward scan for `0F 05 C3` to find the syscall;ret gadget at variable offsets (Win10 `0x12`, Win11 variant `0x14`).
9. **`crowd/src/resolve.rs::ntdll_base_and_name_hashes()` L99-L122** — PEB walk; same pattern as hells_gate but using `LdrDataTableEntry` struct dereference rather than raw offset arithmetic.
10. **`crates/core/src/sys_resolve.rs::gs_read_u64(offset)` L73-L82** — Generic gs-segment reader; reused for any TEB-relative access.
11. **`crates/core/src/sys_resolve.rs::fs_read_u32(offset)` L130-L139** — 32-bit TEB/PEB/TEB→WoW64 access.

### Inline asm usage
- `mov {}, gs:[{:e}]` (x64) — lateout(reg), in(reg) offset, options(nostack, readonly, pure). Used in `sys_resolve.rs::gs_read_u64` and `resolve.rs::gs_read_u64` (duplicate). The `{:e}` format forces 32-bit operand encoding for the offset, matching the GS-relative addressing form.
- `mov {}, gs:[0x60]` (x64) — literal offset version in `hells_gate.rs::find_ntdll_base`. Simpler than the parameterized version.
- `mov {0:e}, fs:[{1}]` (x86) — out(reg), in(reg), options(nostack, readonly, pure). Used for `fs_read_u32`. The `{0:e}` syntax forces 32-bit register encoding on x86.

No clobbers specified beyond defaults — `nostack` asserts no stack manipulation, `readonly` asserts no memory writes, `pure` allows CSE.

### FFI patterns
- All NT structures are `#[repr(C)]` Rust structs (`Peb`, `PebLdrData`, `LdrDataTableEntry`, `ListEntry`, `UnicodeString`, `ImageExportDirectory`, `RuntimeFunctionEntry`). No `extern "C"` declarations — this is pure memory layout, not FFI.
- No handle ownership / RAII — all returned values are raw pointers (`*const u8`) or copy types (`u32`, `usize`).
- The `Vec<u8>` in `ntdll_base_and_name_hashes` (`resolve.rs` L120) allocates per-iteration; minor perf concern but not OPSEC-relevant since allocations are tiny (≤ ~30 bytes).

### Initialization patterns
- No `OnceLock`/`LazyCell` in these files — resolution is called fresh each time. `resolve_all()` is the intended batch API for one-shot population of a `HashMap<String, (u16, usize)>` that callers can cache.
- The `djb2_hash` constant `5381` is hardcoded in three places (sys_resolve.rs L13, resolve.rs L17 + L24, hells_gate.rs L71). No shared constant.

### Error handling
- `hells_gate.rs::resolve_ssn()` returns `anyhow::Result<(u16, usize)>` with `anyhow::anyhow!` for: null ntdll base (L432), empty exports (L438), function not found (L445-L450), all-gates-failed (L462-L465).
- `resolve.rs::resolve_ssn()` returns `(u32, usize)` — no Result, returns `(0, 0)` on failure. **Caller must check for zero SSN.**
- `sys_resolve.rs::resolve_ssn()` — same `(u32, usize)` tuple, same zero-on-failure contract.

### Memory layout
- `ImageExportDirectory` (40 bytes, `#[repr(C)]`) — must match `IMAGE_EXPORT_DIRECTORY` exactly. Field order: characteristics, time_date_stamp, major/minor_version, name, base, number_of_functions, number_of_names, address_of_functions/names/name_ordinals.
- `RuntimeFunctionEntry` (12 bytes, `#[repr(C)]`) — `IMAGE_RUNTIME_FUNCTION_ENTRY`: begin_address, end_address, unwind_info_address.
- `LdrDataTableEntry` layout in `resolve.rs` uses named fields including `reserved1: [*const u8; 2]` ahead of `in_memory_order_links`. This is the canonical Windows `_LDR_DATA_TABLE_ENTRY` layout. `hells_gate.rs::find_ntdll_base` instead uses raw offset arithmetic (`+0x20`, `+0x48`) without the struct — both work, struct is safer.

### Syscall number resolution summary
| Stage | File | Method | Hook-immune? |
|---|---|---|---|
| P1 FreshyCalls | `resolve.rs::resolve_export_ssn` | Zw* RVA sort index | Yes (no stub bytes read) |
| 1 Hell's | `hells_gate.rs::read_ssn_from_stub` | Direct stub read `4C 8B D1 B8 SSN` | No |
| 2 Halo's | `hells_gate.rs::halos_gate` | ±20 neighbor arithmetic | Yes (reads clean neighbors only) |
| 3 Tartarus | `hells_gate.rs::tartarus_gate` | Exception dir + RVA sort | Yes (no stub bytes read) |
| (alt) Hell's with neighbor scan | `resolve.rs::find_syscall_stub64`, `sys_resolve.rs::find_syscall_stub64` | ±512 byte stub scan | Partial (assumes hooks are local) |

## Cross-References Found in Code

### Hard dependencies (T-XXX techniques this code uses)
- **`crowd/src/hells_gate.rs:find_ntdll_base()` L85-L122** → implements **T-004 (PEB Walker)**. Uses `gs:[0x60]` for PEB, walks `InMemoryOrderModuleList` with DJB2 hashing of `BaseDllName`. The whole T-002 chain depends on this module-resolution step.
- **`crowd/src/resolve.rs:ntdll_base_and_name_hashes()` L99-L122** → also implements **T-004 (PEB Walker)** with the same pattern but using the `LdrDataTableEntry` struct.
- **`crowd/src/resolve.rs:find_module_base()` L130-L160** → T-004 generalized to any module by name (case-folded). Used by other techniques that need to resolve kernel32, user32, etc.

### Soft enables (T-XXX techniques this code unlocks)
- **`crowd/src/hells_gate.rs:find_syscall_ret_gadget()` L386-L401** → enables **T-001 (RecycledGate)**. The gadget address returned alongside the SSN is consumed by RecycledGate's indirect dispatch — the `0F 05` instruction executes the syscall from inside ntdll's own image, satisfying stack-based EDR heuristics that expect syscalls to originate from `MEM_IMAGE` in ntdll.
- **`crowd/src/hells_gate.rs:resolve_all()` L478-L528** → enables **T-006 (Phantom Stubs)**. Phantom stubs need SSNs but execute from MEM_IMAGE-backed memory they allocate themselves; the SSN map from `resolve_all()` populates them.
- **`crowd/src/resolve.rs:resolve_export_by_name()` / `resolve_export_by_ordinal()`** → enables any technique that needs non-syscall export resolution (e.g., `MiniDumpWriteDump` for T-023 LSASS dump, `CreateThread` callbacks for T-013 callback injection).
- All NT-direct syscall consumers in `dark_crystal/crowd/src/{pool_party,threadless,early_cascade,early_bird,ghost,herpaderping,dirty_vanity,hypnosis,waiting_thread,mapping_inject,module_stomp,func_stomp,overload,callback_exec,fiber_exec,pe_loader,nt_create_process,ppid}.rs` → these implement **T-007 injection suite** and depend on SSNs from T-002.
- **T-009 EDR evasion suite** (`ntdll_unhook_inject.rs`, `amsi_hbp.rs`, `etw.rs`, `peb_unlink.rs`, `ki_step_over.rs`, `arg_spoof.rs`, `block_handle.rs`, `policy.rs`) — most call NT APIs directly via resolved SSNs.
- **T-005 Ekko sleep obfuscation** uses NtContinue, RtlCreateTimer, etc., all routed through SSNs from T-002.
- **T-016 persistence** (schtask via NtCreateProcess, NTFS EA via NtSetEaFile, etc.) consumes the same SSN map.

### Intra-crate module references
- `crowd/src/chain.rs` (per the technique card) references this as "CASCADE RESOLVER P1" (FreshyCalls) and "CASCADE RESOLVER P4" (exception-based). The chain composer likely calls `resolve.rs::resolve_ssn` for FreshyCalls and `hells_gate.rs::resolve_ssn` for the full cascade.
- `crates/core/src/sys_indirect.rs` (per file manifest) consumes `sys_resolve.rs::resolve_ssn` for the direct/indirect dispatcher — older code path without the full cascade.

## Edge Cases & Failure Modes

1. **All Nt* stubs are heavily rewritten (no clean neighbor within ±20)**
 - Code path: `halos_gate()` returns `None` at L287 after exhausting `1..=20`
 - Symptom: `resolve_ssn()` falls through to Stage 3 Tartarus at L455
 - Workaround: Tartarus handles this case via RVA-only sort (no stub reads)

2. **No Exception Directory present (rare non-x64 or stripped image)**
 - Code path: `tartarus_gate()` L335-L343, `if exc_rva == 0 || exc_size == 0` branch
 - Symptom: falls back to assigning SSNs by sorted RVA of all Nt* exports without exception-directory validation
 - Caveat: includes any forwarded/data exports masquerading as Nt*, possibly corrupting the index assignment

3. **Exception directory filter yields empty set (no Nt* export has unwind data)**
 - Code path: `tartarus_gate()` L357-L363, `if validated.is_empty()` branch
 - Symptom: falls back to unfiltered Nt* sort, same as case 2
 - This shouldn't happen in practice but is defensive

4. **Function name not in Nt* export list (typo, or non-NT function requested)**
 - Code path: `resolve_ssn()` L440-L450, `target_idx = None` branch
 - Symptom: returns `Err(anyhow::anyhow!("function '{}' not found in ntdll exports"))`
 - Workaround: caller must use a real Nt* name; for Zw* calls use FreshyCalls via `resolve.rs::resolve_ssn` which accepts either name (DJB2 hash matches the export name string)

5. **ntdll base not found via PEB walk (corrupted PEB, hardened process)**
 - Code path: `find_ntdll_base()` L119 returns `core::ptr::null()`
 - Symptom: `resolve_ssn()` L432 returns `Err(anyhow::anyhow!("failed to locate ntdll base via PEB"))`
 - Workaround: KnownDlls `NtOpenSection` fallback (per card, in `chain.rs` — not in analyzed files)

6. **Page boundary crossing during stub read**
 - Code path: `resolve.rs::matches_stub64()` L313-L316, `if ((p as usize & 0xFFF) + 4) > 0x1000` returns false
 - Symptom: stub at end of a page is skipped, scan continues
 - This is a safety check — prevents reading across a page boundary into an unmapped or guard page

7. **SSN underflow in Halo's Gate**
 - Code path: `halos_gate()` L269, `if neighbor_ssn >= distance as u16`
 - Symptom: if a "down" neighbor has SSN < distance (e.g., SSN=3 at distance=5), arithmetic would underflow; code skips to next neighbor
 - Workaround: implicit — moves on to next distance or eventually falls to Tartarus

8. **Gadget not found in ±64 bytes from clean stub (Win11 variant layout)**
 - Code path: `find_syscall_ret_gadget()` L386-L401 returns 0
 - Symptom: `resolve_ssn()` L451-L456 calls `find_any_gadget()` to scan all exports
 - Workaround: scans every Nt* export until one yields a gadget; if none found, returns `(ssn, 0)` — caller must validate `gadget != 0` before using RecycledGate dispatch

9. **Forwarded export in `resolve_export_by_name`/`resolve_export_by_ordinal`**
 - Code path: `resolve.rs` L218-L220 and L253-L255, checks `rva >= export_rva && rva < export_rva + export_size`
 - Symptom: returns `null` for forwarded exports (e.g., NTDLL forwarding to KERNELBASE)
 - Workaround: caller must check null and resolve from the forwarder module

10. **32-bit WoW64 process — FreshyCalls Zw* walk still works**
 - Code path: `resolve.rs::resolve_export_ssn` is shared across arch via cfg
 - Symptom: Zw* sort works on x86 too, but Tartarus's `RuntimeFunctionEntry` is x64-only
 - Workaround: Tartarus returns `HashMap::new()` on x86 (L382-L385), forcing RVA-only fallback

## OPSEC Notes

### Artifacts left
- No filesystem artifacts — pure in-memory.
- No handle opens — no `OpenProcess`, no `NtOpenSection`.
- PEB read via `gs:[0x60]` produces no syscall; ETW cannot observe it.
- PE header parsing via raw pointer dereferences — no API calls.

### Telemetry surface
- **Stack scan visibility**: `find_syscall_stub64()` and `find_syscall_ret_gadget()` perform linear byte scans across ntdll's `.text` section. Some advanced EDRs (notably EDR-EI from Elastic) pattern-match on instruction sequences that read code from `MEM_IMAGE` regions — the `*p == 0x4C` comparisons may trigger heuristics.
- **Allocation**: `resolve.rs::ntdll_base_and_name_hashes` and `hells_gate.rs::parse_exports` both build `Vec<u8>` and `Vec<(String, *const u8)>` per call. These heap allocations are visible to `RtlRegisterHeap`-based telemetry. Cache via OnceLock to eliminate.
- **HashSet in Tartarus**: `tartarus_gate()` allocates a `HashSet<u32>` with `entry_count` capacity (potentially ~2000 entries). One-time cost; not a concern if cached.

### Cleanup
- None required — no persistent state modified. All reads are from `MEM_IMAGE` ntdll pages with existing `PAGE_READONLY` protection.

### Detection vectors
1. ETW-TI (Threat Intelligence) providers can hook `RtlpNotImageExecutable` checks and detect byte-scanning patterns.
2. Kernel callbacks (PsSetLoadImageNotifyRoutine) fire when ntdll is loaded — but the PEB walk happens post-load so this is moot.
3. CFG (Control Flow Guard) — not relevant since no indirect calls are made here; only raw memory reads.
4. Memory access patterns visible to Page Heap / Guard Page heuristics if a defender sets a guard page inside ntdll's `.text` section.

## Reusable Patterns

### Pattern: DJB2 Hash + PEB Walk for Module Resolution
- **Use when**: Need to locate a loaded module without `GetModuleHandle`/`LdrLoadDll` API calls
- **Code ref**: `crowd/src/resolve.rs::ntdll_base_and_name_hashes()` L99-L122, `crowd/src/hells_gate.rs::find_ntdll_base()` L85-L122, `crowd/src/resolve.rs::find_module_base()` L130-L160
- **How**: Read `gs:[0x60]` (PEB on x64) or `fs:[0x30]` (PEB on x86). Walk `PEB->Ldr->InMemoryOrderModuleList`. For each `LdrDataTableEntry`, hash `BaseDllName.Buffer` (UTF-16, case-folded via `| 0x20`) with DJB2 seed=5381. Compare against precomputed hash. Return `DllBase` on match. The `addr_of!((*ldr).in_memory_order_module_list) as *const ListEntry` is the loop head sentinel; entries are accessed by subtracting the offset of `in_memory_order_links` from the list link pointer (`entry = (e as *const u8).sub(size_of::<[*const u8; 2]>())`).

### Pattern: PE Export Directory Walk with Hash-Based Name Match
- **Use when**: Need to resolve an export without `GetProcAddress` API call
- **Code ref**: `crowd/src/resolve.rs::resolve_export_ssn()` L194-L259, `crowd/src/hells_gate.rs::parse_exports()` L145-L191
- **How**: Validate `MZ` (0x5A4D) at base, read `e_lfanew` at +0x3C, validate `PE\0\0` (0x4550) at `nt_headers`. Read Export Directory RVA at `nt_headers + 0x88` (x64) or `+0x78` (x86). Walk `AddressOfNames` array (RVAs to ASCII strings), hash each, compare. On match, use the index into `AddressOfNameOrdinals` to get the unbiased ordinal, then index into `AddressOfFunctions` to get the function RVA. Add to base for VA.

### Pattern: SSN Resolution via RVA Sort (FreshyCalls)
- **Use when**: EDR has rewritten syscall stub bodies; you cannot read SSN bytes directly
- **Code ref**: `crowd/src/resolve.rs::resolve_export_ssn()` L226-L245
- **How**: Collect RVAs of all `Zw*` exports during the standard export walk. `sort_unstable()` the RVAs. The index of the target function's RVA in the sorted array *is* its SSN — Windows assigns SSNs in export RVA order. `Zw*` exports are alternate entry points to the same syscalls as `Nt*`, so the sort works identically. No bytes are ever read from any stub, defeating any inline hook.

### Pattern: Exception Directory Cross-Reference for Function Validation
- **Use when**: Need to distinguish real function entry points from forwarded/data exports in a PE
- **Code ref**: `crowd/src/hells_gate.rs::tartarus_gate()` L321-L378
- **How**: Parse `IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_EXCEPTION` (DataDirectory[3], at `nt_headers + 0xA0` on x64). Iterate `RuntimeFunctionEntry` array (12 bytes each: begin_address, end_address, unwind_info_address). Collect all `begin_address` values into a `HashSet<u32>`. Filter export list to only entries whose RVA is in the set. This validates each export is a real function with unwind metadata, not a forwarded export or data symbol.

### Pattern: Gadget Forward-Scan with Bounds Check
- **Use when**: Need to find a `0F 05 C3` (syscall; ret) gadget inside ntdll for indirect syscall dispatch
- **Code ref**: `crowd/src/hells_gate.rs::find_syscall_ret_gadget()` L386-L401, `crowd/src/resolve.rs::find_syscall_stub64()` L261-L307
- **How**: From a stub pointer, scan forward up to 64 bytes (or 512 in the longer variant). Check `*p == 0x0F && *p.add(1) == 0x05 && *p.add(2) == 0xC3`. Use `within_image(p, 3, start, end)` to prevent reading past the image end. The gadget address is the location of `0x0F` — RecycledGate jumps to this address to execute the syscall from inside ntdll's image, satisfying stack-origin heuristics.

### Pattern: Three-Pass Cascade Resolution (Graceful Degradation)
- **Use when**: Resolution must succeed across a range of EDR hooking intensities
- **Code ref**: `crowd/src/hells_gate.rs::resolve_all()` L478-L528
- **How**: Pass 1 attempts the cheapest method (direct read) on every target, collecting unresolved indices. Pass 2 attempts the medium-cost method (neighbor walk) only on unresolved. Pass 3 attempts the most expensive method (full export+exception enumeration, cached) on the remaining. Each pass only operates on failures from the prior, so cost scales with hook coverage rather than total target count.
