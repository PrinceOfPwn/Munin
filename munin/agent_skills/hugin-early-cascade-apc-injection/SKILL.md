# Early Cascade APC Injection — Operator Playbook

## TL;DR
Early Cascade injects shellcode via `NtQueueApcThread` against a `CREATE_SUSPENDED` sacrificial process, queuing the APC so it dispatches during `ntdll!LdrInitializeThunk` — before CRT init, TLS callbacks, and any `DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH` runs. Every NT call routes through RecycledGate (T-001) so ETW-TI sees the kernel transition originating from `ntdll!.text` rather than implant memory. The `early_cascade.rs` file is the polished S-tier reference; `early_bird.rs` is its close-cousin predecessor with the same syscall surface but sloppier error handling.

## Source File Map

| File | Role | Key Exports | Size |
|---|---|---|---|
| `dark_crystal/crowd/src/early_cascade.rs` | Polished S-tier implementation: factored `cascade_inject_into` core, dedicated PID-query helper, strict W^X abort path, Win32-free PPID variant. | `cascade_inject()`, `cascade_inject_ppid()`, `cascade_inject_default()` | ~12K |
| `dark_crystal/crowd/src/early_bird.rs` | Earlier "Early Bird" variant — same syscall path (NtQueueApcThread via RecycledGate) but inline PID query, non-fatal protection-flip failure, unchecked NtResumeThread. | `early_bird_inject()`, `early_bird_default()`, `early_bird_with_ppid()` | ~10K |

The two files implement essentially the same technique — the only meaningful divergence is that `early_cascade.rs` aborts cleanly on `NtProtectVirtualMemory` failure whereas `early_bird.rs` continues with a dbg warning (leaving a RW page that will fault at APC dispatch). Both `early_bird_*` entrypoints route through `crate::recycled::*` (T-001), making them effectively identical in OPSEC profile despite the historical name difference.

## How It Works

The technique exploits the fact that a thread created in `CREATE_SUSPENDED` state still walks `ntdll!LdrInitializeThunk` when resumed — and APCs queued against it fire *inside* that initialization cascade, before the PE entry point. Combined with pure-NT syscalls via RecycledGate (T-001), the kernel transitions all appear to originate from `ntdll!.text`, defeating ETW-TI stack-based detection.

**Step 1 — Sacrificial process creation.** The non-PPID path calls `winapi::um::processthreadsapi::CreateProcessW` directly with `CREATE_SUSPENDED` (0x4) and an `STARTUPINFOW`/`PROCESS_INFORMATION` pair. This is the *only* Win32 call in the entire technique. The PPID path (`cascade_inject_ppid`) instead delegates to `crate::ppid::spawn_with_ppid_spoof(target_exe, parent_pid, true)` — `true` = suspended — which (per T-015) uses `NtCreateUserProcess` with a `RTL_USER_PROCESS_PARAMETERS` populated for a spoofed parent. Raw `hProcess` / `hThread` handles are extracted via `pi.hProcess as usize` (downcast) and passed forward as `usize`.

**Step 2 — Remote allocation (`NtAllocateVirtualMemory`).** `crate::recycled::nt_allocate_virtual_memory(h_proc_raw, &mut remote_addr, 0, &mut region_size, MEM_COMMIT_RESERVE, PAGE_READWRITE)` allocates exactly `shellcode.len()` bytes. The region starts as **RW** — never RWX. The `ZeroBits` argument is 0 (any address). The check `status < 0 || remote_addr.is_null()` covers both NTSTATUS failures and the rare success-but-null case. On failure: `nt_terminate_process(h_proc_raw, 1)`, `nt_close(h_thread_raw)`, `nt_close(h_proc_raw)`, then bail with the NTSTATUS.

**Step 3 — Shellcode write (`NtWriteVirtualMemory`).** `crate::recycled::nt_write_virtual_memory(h_proc_raw, remote_addr, shellcode.as_ptr() as *const c_void, shellcode.len(), &mut written)` copies the payload in. The `written` out-parameter is captured (debug log compares it to `shellcode.len()`). On failure: `nt_free_virtual_memory` with `MEM_RELEASE` to release the page, then terminate+close.

**Step 4 — Protection flip (`NtProtectVirtualMemory`).** `crate::recycled::nt_protect_virtual_memory(h_proc_raw, &mut base_prot, &mut prot_size, PAGE_EXECUTE_READ, &mut old_protect)` flips RW→RX. This is the W^X invariant — the page is never simultaneously writable and executable. **`early_cascade.rs` treats this step as fatal** (abort path frees memory + terminates + closes handles), explicitly noting in the comment that "if protection flip fails, the shellcode page stays RW — DEP won't protect it" and "abort to avoid leaving a RW+executable region that EDRs can flag". The `early_bird.rs` counterpart is *less safe*: it only logs a `mega_dbg!` warning and continues, which means an RX-failed page will fault when the APC dispatcher jumps to it, leaving a zombie process and a louder crash signature.

**Step 5 — APC queue (`NtQueueApcThread` — NOT `QueueUserAPC`).** `crate::recycled::nt_queue_apc_thread(h_thread_raw, remote_addr as *mut c_void, null_mut(), null_mut(), 0)` queues a kernel APC against the suspended main thread. The four-arg signature matches the NT APC prototype: `Routine = remote_addr` (our shellcode), `Arg1/Arg2/Arg3 = null`. Crucially this is `NtQueueApcThread`, not `kernel32!QueueUserAPC` — no Win32 wrapper, no ETW user-mode provider firing, no `KernelObject` kernel-mode telemetry beyond the syscall itself. The comment block at L137-L152 explicitly calls out that "the APC dispatcher in ntdll fires our routine during the initialization cascade -- before LdrInitializeThunk completes".

**Step 6 — Thread resume (`NtResumeThread`).** `crate::recycled::nt_resume_thread(h_thread_raw, &mut prev_count)` decrements the suspend count from 1→0. The `prev_count` out-param confirms the prior suspended state. As soon as the thread becomes runnable, the kernel's `KiUserApcDispatcher` path runs *before* the user-mode thread context resumes — the queued APC routine (shellcode) executes synchronously, inside `LdrInitializeThunk`'s `NtTestAlert` call, before CRT init / TLS callbacks / `DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH`. `early_cascade.rs` checks NTSTATUS and terminates the zombie on failure; `early_bird_inject` (non-PPID path) calls `nt_resume_thread(h_thread_raw, std::ptr::null_mut())` and discards the result — a latent bug if the syscall fails silently.

**Step 7 — Handle cleanup.** Both handles closed via `crate::recycled::nt_close`. The shellcode process keeps running; the operator is responsible for lifecycle management.

**Call graph (early_cascade.rs):**
- `cascade_inject_default` → `cascade_inject` → `cascade_inject_into`
- `cascade_inject_ppid` → `crate::ppid::spawn_with_ppid_spoof` (T-015) → `query_pid_from_handle` → `cascade_inject_into`
- `cascade_inject_into` → `crate::recycled::{nt_allocate_virtual_memory, nt_write_virtual_memory, nt_protect_virtual_memory, nt_queue_apc_thread, nt_resume_thread, nt_free_virtual_memory, nt_terminate_process, nt_close}` (all T-001)
- `query_pid_from_handle` → `crate::recycled::nt_query_information_process` (T-001) with class 0 (`ProcessBasicInformation`)

**Call graph (early_bird.rs):** Identical pattern, but with the core 6-step inlined into each public function (no shared `cascade_inject_into` helper) and an inline `PBI` struct inside `early_bird_with_ppid`.

**Data flow:** Shellcode (`&[u8]`) is borrowed for the duration of the call, never copied into a heap allocation in the implant's own address space — it's streamed directly through `nt_write_virtual_memory`. Raw handles flow as `usize` (not `HANDLE` or `OwnedHandle`) — the unsafe contract is that successful paths close both handles and failure paths close both handles and terminate the process. There is no RAII guard; correctness relies on the explicit `nt_close` calls in every exit branch.

**Type hierarchy:** Only one named struct (`ProcessBasicInformation` in `query_pid_from_handle`), defined `#[repr(C)]` with six `usize` fields matching the Windows `PROCESS_BASIC_INFORMATION` layout on x64 (48 bytes total). The early_bird variant uses an inline anonymous `PBI { _pad: [usize; 4], unique_pid: usize, _inh: usize }` — same memory layout, different naming convention.

**Feature gates:** None directly in this file. `#![allow(dead_code, non_snake_case)]` at the top of both files indicates they may be compiled out under certain configs. The `mega_dbg!` macro is presumably cfg-gated elsewhere (T-021 patterns) to strip debug strings from production builds.

## Operational Profile

### When to Use
- Engagement requires code execution that fires before any EDR hook is in place (CRT, IAT, ETW-TI user-mode providers, mini-stack-walk callbacks).
- Target is a same-architecture user-mode process (no cross-arch injection — `nt_write_virtual_memory` doesn't thunk).
- You can accept a sacrificial process appearing in the process tree (mitigated by `cascade_inject_ppid`).
- Operator controls the shellcode buffer (no reflectively-loaded PE — that's T-013 PE loader territory).

### When NOT to Use
- Cross-architecture injection (e.g., 64-bit implant injecting into 32-bit `syswow64` process): would need Wow64 thunking, which `NtQueueApcThread` doesn't handle natively.
- When the sacrificial process must persist silently after execution — the spawned process is visible in Task Manager / `ps`.
- When you need to inject into an already-running process — use `Early Bird` against a legitimately suspended thread, or Threadless (T-008) / Pool Party (T-007) instead.
- When EDR performs *deep* static scanning of newly-committed RX regions in spawned processes (e.g., CrowdStrike Falcon's memory scanning at thread-create events). Pre-LdrInitializeThunk doesn't help against this — the scan happens post-APC-dispatch.

### Kill Chain Position
Example chain:
- **T-004** (PEB walk) → **T-002** (Hells/Halos/Tartarus SSN resolution) → **T-001** (RecycledGate syscall surface) → **T-015** (PPID-spoofed spawn, optional) → **T-012** (Early Cascade injection) → **T-005** (Ekko ROP sleep) → **T-017** (persistence suite) / **T-019** (dead-drop C2)

T-012 sits at the **execution delivery** stage — it's how the implant (dark_crystal core payload, already decoded by T-021) gets into a fresh address space. It is *enabled by* T-001 (without RecycledGate it loses its pre-LdrInitializeThunk OPSEC claim) and *consumed by* T-017/T-018/T-019 modules that need a running shellcode process to attach persistence/C2 logic to.

### Trade-offs

## Rust Implementation Deep Dive

### `unsafe` blocks

**`cascade_inject_into(h_proc_raw, h_thread_raw, shellcode, pid)` — single `unsafe fn` declaration, body executes unsafely throughout.**
The function is itself declared `unsafe` rather than wrapping individual calls — appropriate here because every operation touches raw pointers / FFI to NT syscalls. The contract: caller passes valid open handles; on success both handles are closed by the function; on failure both are closed *and* the process is terminated. There is no path that leaks handles.

**`query_pid_from_handle(h_proc: usize) -> u32` — `unsafe fn`.**
Defines a stack-local `#[repr(C)] struct ProcessBasicInformation` with 6 `usize` fields. Calls `crate::recycled::nt_query_information_process` with `ProcessInformationClass = 0` (ProcessBasicInformation). Returns `pbi.unique_pid as u32` on `status == 0`, else `0u32`. Note: on x86 (4-byte `usize`), the struct layout would not match the real `PROCESS_BASIC_INFORMATION` because of the `KPRIORITY` (LONG, 4 bytes) field — but the implant targets x64 only (see min_windows).

**`cascade_inject(...)` — `unsafe {... }` block.**
The only unsafe block in the function. Creates `STARTUPINFOW`/`PROCESS_INFORMATION` via `std::mem::zeroed()`, populates `si.cb`, calls `CreateProcessW`. Then delegates to `cascade_inject_into`.

**`cascade_inject_ppid(...)` — two `unsafe` blocks.**
First block (small): just calls `query_pid_from_handle(h_proc_raw)`. Second block (the actual injection): delegates to `cascade_inject_into` — handles consumed internally.

### `core::arch::asm!` usage
None directly in either file. The `asm!` is in `dark_crystal/crates/core/src/sys_recycled.rs` (T-001 RecycledGate) — that's where the `JMP ntdll_gadget` lives. The present files only invoke `crate::recycled::*` FFI functions.

### FFI patterns

- **Win32 (only in non-PPID path):** `winapi::um::processthreadsapi::CreateProcessW` + `STARTUPINFOW` + `PROCESS_INFORMATION` + `winapi::um::errhandlingapi::GetLastError`. Uses raw `winapi` crate (not the newer `windows` crate). Handle ownership: returned `hProcess` / `hThread` are owned by the caller — they are *not* wrapped in `OwnedHandle`; they flow as raw `usize` through `as` casts.
- **NT syscalls:** Every NT call is a `crate::recycled::*` function. These are wrappers (defined in `dark_crystal/crowd/src/recycled.rs` per T-001) that invoke the syscall via indirect JMP into an `ntdll!.text` `0F 05 C3` gadget. The signatures match the Windows NT prototypes:
 - `nt_allocate_virtual_memory(h_proc, base_addr *mut, zero_bits, region_size *mut, alloc_type, prot) -> i32`
 - `nt_write_virtual_memory(h_proc, base_addr, buffer *const, len, written *mut) -> i32`
 - `nt_protect_virtual_memory(h_proc, base_addr *mut, size *mut, new_prot, old_prot *mut) -> i32`
 - `nt_queue_apc_thread(h_thread, routine, arg1, arg2, arg3) -> i32` — note arg3 is `0`, not `null_mut()`; this is the `0` integer, which is fine for an unused APC arg.
 - `nt_resume_thread(h_thread, prev_count *mut) -> i32`
 - `nt_close(handle) -> i32`
 - `nt_terminate_process(h_proc, exit_status) -> i32`
 - `nt_free_virtual_memory(h_proc, base_addr *mut, size *mut, free_type) -> i32`
 - `nt_query_information_process(h_proc, class, buf *mut, len, ret_len *mut) -> i32`

All return `i32` NTSTATUS. The convention `< 0` means failure — this is technically imprecise (NT_SUCCESS is `>= 0`, NTSTATUS is signed); the code's `status < 0` check covers the high bit set (`0x80000000+`) but misses the `0x40000000`–`0x7FFFFFFF` NTSTATUS_WARNING range — in practice none of these syscalls return warnings, so the check is safe.

### Initialization patterns
- `std::mem::zeroed()` for `STARTUPINFOW` / `PROCESS_INFORMATION` / `ProcessBasicInformation` — idiomatic for FFI structs where zero-init is required.
- `Vec<u16>` for UTF-16 path with `chain(std::iter::once(0))` for NUL terminator.
- No `OnceLock`/`LazyCell` in this file — those live in T-001 (syscall SSN resolution) and T-021 (config).

### Error handling
- `anyhow::Result<u32>` for `cascade_inject*` (newer idiomatic style).
- `Result<u32, String>` for `early_bird_*` (older style; carries lossy error strings).
- Every NT call has an explicit `if status < 0 {...; anyhow::bail!(...) }` block with a `mega_dbg!` log + structured cleanup.
- The cleanup sequence is identical at every failure point: `nt_free_virtual_memory` → `nt_terminate_process` → `nt_close(h_thread)` → `nt_close(h_proc)` → `bail!`. The only failure path that omits `nt_free_virtual_memory` is the very first allocation failure (nothing to free yet).
- Comments are explicit about the *why* — e.g., the `NtProtectVirtualMemory` failure comment explains that an RW-only page would defeat DEP and flag EDRs.

### Memory layout
- `ProcessBasicInformation` (early_cascade.rs L201-L207): 6 × `usize` = 48 bytes on x64. Matches `PROCESS_BASIC_INFORMATION` layout exactly.
- `PBI` (early_bird.rs L155-L157): `{ _pad: [usize; 4], unique_pid: usize, _inh: usize }` = 6 × `usize` = 48 bytes. Same layout.
- The `_pad` style is uglier (anonymous placeholder) but binary-identical.

### Syscall numbers
None resolved in this file — SSN resolution is in `sys_resolve.rs` / `hells_gate.rs` (T-002). This file just consumes the `crate::recycled::*` API.

## Cross-References Found in Code

- `early_cascade.rs:1` (module docstring) → references **T-001** (RecycledGate) — "All NT calls go through RecycledGate (JMP into ntdll's `0F 05 C3` gadget)"
- `early_cascade.rs:use crate::recycled::*` → **T-001** dependency on every NT call (`nt_allocate_virtual_memory`, `nt_write_virtual_memory`, `nt_protect_virtual_memory`, `nt_queue_apc_thread`, `nt_resume_thread`, `nt_close`, `nt_terminate_process`, `nt_free_virtual_memory`, `nt_query_information_process`)
- `early_cascade.rs:cascade_inject_ppid()` L294 → calls **T-015** (`crate::ppid::spawn_with_ppid_spoof`) — PPID-spoofed process creation
- `early_cascade.rs:cascade_inject()` L235 → calls **Win32 `CreateProcessW`** — the only non-NT call, deliberate Win32 for the non-PPID path (matches technique card exactly)
- `early_cascade.rs:cascade_inject_default()` L312 → hardcoded path `C:\Windows\System32\svchost.exe` — sacrificial process choice (sensible, blendable)
- `early_cascade.rs:use crate::mega_dbg!` → **T-021 patterns** (debug logging macro, presumably cfg-gated for production builds)
- `early_bird.rs:1` (module docstring) → self-references as "the closest available implementation to Early Cascade Injection (Outflank's Shim Engine abuse)" — acknowledges the technique card's framing
- `early_bird.rs:early_bird_with_ppid()` L143 → calls **T-015** (`crate::ppid::spawn_with_ppid_spoof`)

No direct calls to T-002 (Hells Gate SSN resolution), T-005 (Ekko sleep), T-007 (Pool Party), T-008 (Threadless), T-009 (Process Ghosting), T-014 (NtCreateUserProcess) from these files. The injection surface is deliberately minimal.

## Edge Cases & Failure Modes

1. **`CreateProcessW` returns 0 (non-PPID path).**
 - Failure path: L252 `if ok == 0 { anyhow::bail!(... GetLastError()) }`.
 - Symptom: no process, no handles, immediate error.
 - Workaround: caller should retry with a different sacrificial path or use the PPID path (`cascade_inject_ppid`) which goes through `crate::ppid` and may handle path resolution differently.

2. **`NtAllocateVirtualMemory` returns NTSTATUS ≥ 0 but `remote_addr.is_null()`.**
 - Caught by the `|| remote_addr.is_null()` short-circuit at L65.
 - Symptom: rare edge case where the kernel returns success but a null base (e.g., constrained memory pressure on Win11 with custom mitigations).
 - Workaround: code terminates the process and bails. Could retry with a smaller region or different process.

3. **`NtWriteVirtualMemory` partial write (status ≥ 0, `written != shellcode.len()`).**
 - Not currently checked — the code only checks `status < 0` and trusts `written` to be the full payload length.
 - Symptom: silent corruption — shellcode truncated, will fault at APC dispatch.
 - Workaround: add `if written != shellcode.len() { bail! }`. Operator patch needed.

4. **`NtProtectVirtualMemory` fails (early_cascade path).**
 - Code aborts cleanly (L120-L130): free + terminate + close + bail.
 - Symptom: process terminated, no zombie.
 - Workaround: explicitly handled. The comment notes that continuing would leave a RW page that would either fault (DEP) or flag EDRs scanning for RW-executable mismatches.

5. **`NtProtectVirtualMemory` fails (early_bird path — L70-L74).**
 - Code logs a warning and *continues* — different behavior from early_cascade.
 - Symptom: RW page is queued as the APC routine; APC dispatcher will execute the RW page; on modern Windows with CET/DEP, this triggers an access violation in `KiUserApcDispatcher`; the process crashes loudly.
 - Workaround: **prefer `cascade_inject_*` over `early_bird_*` for ops** — early_cascade's strict abort path is correct.

6. **`NtQueueApcThread` fails.**
 - Both files abort cleanly. Handles closed, process terminated, memory freed.
 - Symptom: no shellcode executes, no zombie.
 - Workaround: caller can retry with a different target.

7. **`NtResumeThread` fails (early_cascade, L172-L184).**
 - Aborts cleanly with `nt_terminate_process` + `nt_close`.
 - Symptom: process terminated, shellcode memory is gone (process died with it).

8. **`NtResumeThread` failure in `early_bird_inject` non-PPID path (L113-L115).**
 - NTSTATUS discarded — `crate::recycled::nt_resume_thread(h_thread_raw, std::ptr::null_mut());` no check.
 - Symptom: thread never resumes; shellcode never executes; process stays suspended indefinitely; **zombie svchost.exe in suspended state** — this is a *loud* EDR signal.
 - Workaround: **always prefer `cascade_inject` over `early_bird_inject`** for ops, or patch `early_bird_inject` to check NTSTATUS.

9. **Race: thread resumed externally between Step 5 (queue APC) and Step 6 (resume).**
 - Not handled. If another process (debugger, EDR test harness) calls `NtResumeThread` on the sacrificial thread first, the queued APC may fire *before* our `nt_resume_thread` call returns — but the implant's `prev_count` will read `0`, indicating the thread was already runnable.
 - Symptom: `prev_count == 0` returned from `nt_resume_thread`; shellcode may or may not have already executed.

10. **Race: process exits between APC queue and resume.**
 - Not handled. The `NtResumeThread` would return `STATUS_THREAD_IS_TERMINATING` or similar.
 - Symptom: `nt_resume_thread` fails — caught by early_cascade's check; early_bird non-PPID path would silently leak.

11. **`ProcessBasicInformation` struct size mismatch on x86.**
 - The 6 × `usize` layout is only correct on x64 (`usize` = 8 bytes). On x86 (`usize` = 4 bytes), the struct is 24 bytes vs the real 24 bytes (with `KPRIORITY` = 4 bytes) — coincidentally correct on x86 because `BasePriority` fits in `usize`.
 - Symptom: would actually work on both architectures, but only by accident.
 - Workaround: use `windows_targets` / explicit `c_void` typing if x86 support is needed.

## OPSEC Notes

### Artifacts left
- A new process running the sacrificial exe (default: `C:\Windows\System32\svchost.exe`) — visible in Task Manager / `tasklist` / Sysmon EID 1.
- Memory: a private (not MEM_IMAGE) RX region in that process containing the shellcode — detectable by `pe-sieve`, Moneta, Hunt-Sleeping-Beacons scanning for private executable memory.
- ETW-TI kernel telemetry: `NtAllocateVirtualMemory`, `NtWriteVirtualMemory`, `NtProtectVirtualMemory` (RW→RX is the *classic* shellcode signature), `NtQueueApcThread`, `NtResumeThread` — all observable in the kernel ETW provider. The mitigating factor: stack walk shows the calls originating from `ntdll!.text` (RecycledGate gadget), not from implant memory. ETW-TI's `NtProtectVirtualMemory` heuristic may still flag the RW→RX flip on a private region even with the spoofed return address.
- Process tree shows `svchost.exe` parented by the implant process (non-PPID path) — use `cascade_inject_ppid` to parent it under `explorer.exe` or another benign process.

### Telemetry cleaned up
- Handles to the sacrificial process are closed via `NtClose` — no handle leak.
- On failure paths: process is terminated, memory is freed, handles are closed — no zombie.
- `mega_dbg!` strings compiled out under release builds (presumably via `cfg!(debug_assertions)` gate in `mega_dbg!` definition — verify in T-021 patterns).

### Telemetry NOT cleaned up
- The sacrificial process itself remains running post-injection. Operator must arrange cleanup (e.g., self-terminate the shellcode after a fixed lifetime, or use `crate::recycled::nt_terminate_process` from the shellcode before returning).
- No PEB unlink of the new process — but it's a legitimate system binary (`svchost.exe`), so PEB-walking EDRs see a real Microsoft-signed image. The injected RX region in private memory is the giveaway, not the PEB.
- No `LDR` module list manipulation — the sacrificial `svchost.exe` has its normal DLL list; only the private RX region is anomalous.

### Best practice
- Use `cascade_inject_ppid` (not `cascade_inject`) — gets you full NT-only process creation via T-015.
- Choose a non-default sacrificial exe that *plausibly* runs in your context — `svchost.exe` running without `svchost.exe -k <group>` command line is a known EDR heuristic. Consider `notepad.exe`, `calc.exe`, or `RuntimeBroker.exe`.
- Pair with **T-005 Ekko sleep** post-injection so the shellcode encrypts its own memory during idle windows — defeats Moneta / pe-sieve snapshots.
- Pair with **T-009 PEB unlink** if the operator module ever loads additional DLLs into the sacrificial process.

## Reusable Patterns

### Pattern: NT-only failure-cleanup triple (`free + terminate + close`)
- **Use when**: any NT-injection sequence where the operator must guarantee no handle/process leak on partial failure.
- **Code ref**: `early_cascade.rs:cascade_inject_into()` failure paths at L75-L80, L99-L106, L120-L130, L153-L160, L177-L184.
- **How**: The invariant is — once memory is allocated, every subsequent failure path must execute `nt_free_virtual_memory` (release the page) → `nt_terminate_process` (kill the zombie) → `nt_close(h_thread)` → `nt_close(h_proc)` before bailing. The first allocation step skips `nt_free_virtual_memory` (nothing allocated yet). This avoids the `early_bird.rs` bug where `early_bird_inject` continues on `NtProtectVirtualMemory` failure — early_cascade treats every NTSTATUS < 0 as fatal with full cleanup. Reuse this exact pattern in any new injection technique.

### Pattern: PID extraction via `NtQueryInformationProcess` class 0
- **Use when**: you have a raw `hProcess` handle and need the PID *without* invoking Win32 `GetProcessId` (which routes through kernel32 and may be hooked).
- **Code ref**: `early_cascade.rs:query_pid_from_handle()` L195-L218.
- **How**: Define a `#[repr(C)]` struct mirroring `PROCESS_BASIC_INFORMATION` (`{ exit_status, peb_base, affinity_mask, base_priority, unique_pid, inherited_from }` — all `usize`). Call `nt_query_information_process(h_proc, 0, &mut pbi as *mut _ as *mut u8, size_of::<PBI>() as u32, &mut ret_len)`. On `status == 0`, return `pbi.unique_pid as u32`. Returns `0` on failure (non-fatal — caller can fall back to `pi.dwProcessId` if available).

### Pattern: Factored core-with-public-wrappers
- **Use when**: a technique has multiple entrypoints (default target, custom target, PPID variant) that share the actual injection sequence.
- **Code ref**: `early_cascade.rs` — `cascade_inject_into()` is the unsafe core; `cascade_inject()`, `cascade_inject_ppid()`, `cascade_inject_default()` are thin wrappers that handle process creation differently then delegate.
- **How**: The public wrappers vary Step 1 (process creation) but delegate Steps 2–6 to the shared `cascade_inject_into(h_proc_raw, h_thread_raw, shellcode, pid)`. This avoids duplicating the 6-step sequence (which `early_bird.rs` unfortunately does — duplicating it three times with subtly different bugs in each copy). Always use the factored pattern; never the duplicated one.

### Pattern: `usize` handle passing
- **Use when**: passing Win32/NT handles across module boundaries in Rust without `OwnedHandle` / `HANDLE` wrapper noise.
- **Code ref**: `early_cascade.rs:cascade_inject_into(h_proc_raw: usize, h_thread_raw: usize,...)`.
- **How**: Cast `pi.hProcess as usize` at the call site, accept `usize` in the callee, cast back to whatever the FFI expects inside `crate::recycled::*`. Trade-off: loses the type safety of `BorrowedHandle<'_>` lifetimes — but matches the codebase convention (T-001's `crate::recycled::*` accepts `usize`). The contract is documented on the function ("Handles are consumed (closed on error paths, caller closes on success)") — be vigilant that this contract is upheld on every code path.

### Pattern: W^X-compliant shellcode staging
- **Use when**: writing shellcode to a remote process — never have the page simultaneously W and X.
- **Code ref**: `early_cascade.rs:cascade_inject_into()` Steps 2–4 — allocate `PAGE_READWRITE`, write shellcode, then `nt_protect_virtual_memory` flip to `PAGE_EXECUTE_READ`.
- **How**: This is the textbook W^X pattern and defeats both DEP-violation scans and RWX-page telemetry. The *critical* detail is the abort-on-failure path in Step 4: if `NtProtectVirtualMemory` returns NTSTATUS < 0, the page is stuck at RW — never execute it. Free + terminate + bail. `early_bird.rs`'s warn-and-continue behavior here is wrong; don't copy it.
